# rhfun

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A new mixed collection of my handy R functions.

Beware: all the material must be considered experimental, in full
development, not yet tested.

Caveat emptor: use it at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ‘rhfun’ from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("maxbre/rhfun")
```

or with:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxbre/rhfun")
```
